# Slack_Listeners_App

Slack RTM :

The Real Time Messaging API is a WebSocket-based API that allows you to receive events from Slack in real-time and send messages as users. It’s sometimes referred to just as the “RTM API”.

In this program, we have used Slack SDK for implementing RTM. RTM isn’t available for modern scoped apps anymore. So, we implemented a standalone app using the Events API and Web API instead. 

Slack Events API :

The Events API is a streamlined, easy way to build apps and bots that respond to activities in Slack. All you need is a Slack app and a secure place for us to send your events.
